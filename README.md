# Brain-Tumor-classification-with-deep-learning
The aim of this project is to train a neural network to recognise brain tumour classes. 
By training a neural network built on the basis of a model from the EffNet family, it was possible to achieve excellent levels of prediction accuracy and model robustness.
This project forms part of the deep learning course taught during the final year of the bioengineering master's degree and was entirely done in google colab.
